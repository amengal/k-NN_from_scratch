# k-NN_from_scratch
The project contains a "from scratch implementation" of the k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.
The algorithm is used to predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit.
The performance is then compared to scikit-learn's built-in knn algorithm.
Both models show the exact same cross validated f1 score(micro average).
